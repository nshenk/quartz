Welcome. My name's Nate â€” I currently do business development and engineering at [Nocturne Automation](https://nocturneautomation.com). Nocturne develops AI integrations and automated workflows, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a completely AI-run company (while maintaining revenue growth).

This website is a new project. It can be thought of as a digital garden for my thoughts and ideas as I develop them. The notes you read here are ideas I am developing with the aim of improving them, not firm declarations of unwavering belief. The intention is to build a personal knowledge graph over time, and then train an AI on it to replace me. Enjoy your stay.
