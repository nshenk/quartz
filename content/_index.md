Welcome. My name's Nate â€” I currently do business development and engineering at [Nocturne Automation](https://nocturneautomation.com). 

This website is a new project. It can be thought of as a digital garden for my thoughts and ideas as I develop them. The intention is to build a personal knowledge graph over time, and then train an AI on it to replace me. Enjoy your stay.
