title: "On Sustainability"
---

Our civilization incentivizes the creation and utilization of new knowledge, unlike the "sustainable" civilizations of the past (at least the civilizations that we know of).

Sustainability vs a series of unsustainabilities rectified by increasing technological progress in an infinite ascent of man. 

An ounce of prevention is only worth a pound of cure if you know exactly what to prevent in the first place.

Problem solving ability > sustainability.

Predictions of future problems can't take into account solutions that will be developed along the way, and thus all projections of doom are empty.
