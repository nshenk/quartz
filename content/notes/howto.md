# Using this website

This website contains my notes. You can navigate in several ways:

- View all notes sorted by recency at [/notes/](https://ftlsid.com/notes/)
- View micro-notes sorted by recency at [/notes/micro/](https://ftlsid.com/notes/micro/). These are off-the-cuff thoughts inspired by the tweet format.
- Use the interactive graph below
- Do a full-text search by pressing `/` (TODO: make this work on mobile)
- Subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://ftlsid.com/index.xml)
