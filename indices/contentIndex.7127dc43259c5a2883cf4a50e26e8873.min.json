You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e üîó Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet. This is *highly recommended* but not required.\n\n\u003e üëÄ Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](preview%20changes.md)\n\nFor those who like to live life more on the edge, viewing the garden through Obsidian gets you pretty close to the real thing.\n\n## Publishing Changes\nNow that you know the basics of managing your digital garden using Quartz, you can publish it to the internet!\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](hosting.md)\n\nHaving problems?
