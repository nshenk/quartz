Nocturne develops AI integrations and automated workflows, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a completely AI-run company (while maintaining revenue growth).\n\nThis website is a new project. It can be thought of as a digital garden for my thoughts and ideas as I develop them. The notes you read here are ideas I am developing with the aim of improving them, not firm declarations of unwavering belief. The intention is to build a personal knowledge graph over time, and then train an AI on it to replace me. Enjoy your stay.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T02:14:35.588086677Z","tags":[]},"/notes/firstprinciples":{"title":"First Principles","content":"\n[sustainability](notes/sustainability)","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T02:14:35.588086677Z","tags":[]},"/notes/howto":{"title":"Using this site","content":"\n# Using this website\n\nThis website contains my notes.
