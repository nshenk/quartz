Nocturne develops AI integrations and automated workflows, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a completely AI-run company (while maintaining revenue growth).\n\nThis website is a new project.

The intention is to build a personal knowledge graph over time, and then train an AI on it to replace me. Enjoy your stay.\n\n[All Notes](notes/)","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T00:58:21.444498898Z","tags":[]},"/notes/sustainability":{"title":"On Sustainability","content":"\nOur civilization incentivizes the creation and utilization of new knowledge, unlike the \"sustainable\" civilizations of the past (at least the civilizations that we know of).\n\nSustainability vs a series of unsustainabilities rectified by increasing technological progress in an infinite ascent of man. \n\nAn ounce of prevention is only worth a pound of cure if you know exactly what to prevent in the first place.\n\nProblem solving ability \u003e sustainability.\n\nPredictions of future problems can't take into account solutions that will be developed along the way, and thus all projections of doom are empty.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T00:58:21.444498898Z","tags":[]}}
