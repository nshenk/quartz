{"/":{"title":"Home","content":"\n\nWelcome. My name's Nate â€” I currently do business development and engineering at [Nocturne Automation](https://nocturneautomation.com). Nocturne develops AI integrations and automated workflows, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a completely AI-run company (while maintaining revenue growth).\n\nThis website is a new project. It can be thought of as a digital garden for my thoughts and ideas as I develop them. The notes you read here are ideas I am developing with the aim of improving them, not firm declarations of unwavering belief. The intention is to build a personal knowledge graph over time, and then [train an AI on it to replace me](./notes/neural_espionage). Enjoy your stay.\n\n# Using this website\n\nThis website contains my notes. Blue text are links. You can navigate in several ways:\n\n- View all notes sorted by recency at [/notes/](./notes/)\n- Use the interactive graph of the entire website below\n- Do a full-text search using the search bar at the top right","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T03:45:38.786034356Z","tags":[]},"/notes/neural_espionage":{"title":"Neural Espionage","content":"\nI recently had a conversation with a friend and prolific Twitter user who said he had trained GPT-3.5 on all of his tweets, and then talked to it. The fine-tuned LLM generated ideas that my friend had had before, but had never written down anywhere. I recently had a similar experience with my own Twitter account. Spooky to say the least.\n\n\n\nImagine the intelligence implications of this technology. Given a large enough corpus of genuine text from someone, you can essentially use AI to get into their head. You can extract beliefs and ideas from their brain without ever interacting with them directly.  \n\n\n\nThis technology could be used learn about a person of interest on an intimate level. It could help the operator take their sales meeting prep to a new level. It could be used to social engineer someone in a cyber attack. Or to have next-generation parasocial relationships. It could even be used to commit thought-theft - a future crime where the attacker steals thoughts or ideas from the victim's mind (i.e. sensitive secrets). \n\n\n\nOne defense against this is obviously to never post anything on the internet. If you do, make sure it's not your genuine thoughts. And if you must post your genuine thoughts, make sure you're interleaving some disinformation (i.e. insincere thoughts). Still, there are other (slightly more difficult) ways to get in your head - maybe you use the notes app on your phone, or you have genuine conversations with others (that can be secretly recorded), or you talk out loud to yourself (which can be secretly recorded). Anyways, I'm very excited to watch (and possibly participate in) the burgeoning new field of neural espionage.","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T03:45:38.786034356Z","tags":[]}}
